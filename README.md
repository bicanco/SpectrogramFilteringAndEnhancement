### Abstract
The objective of this project is to remove noise and enhance the spectrograms generated from audio records of soundscapes provided by the Laboratory of Spatial Ecology and Conservantion (LEEC), located at the UNESP's campus of Rio Claro. The main processing tasks involved in this project, are image filtering followed by image enhancement of the spectrograms. The spectrograms are generated by applying a Fast Fourier transform (FFT) to the audios. These spectrograms are used in the field of bioacoustics and soundscape ecology to help characterize the soundscape and identify species present in the recordings. The output images of this project are spectrograms with reduced noise and enhanced events, presumably helping in species identification.

### Main objective

The objective of this project is to remove noise and enhance the spectrograms generated from audio records of soundscapes provided by the Laboratory of Spatial Ecology and Conservantion (LEEC), located at the UNESP's campus of Rio Claro.


### Description of the input images

The input images are grayscale images generated with the **generateImage.py** script from some of the audios provided by the Laboratory of Spatial Ecology and Conservantion (LEEC), located at the UNESP's campus of Rio Claro. The script applies a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the audio signals through the *specgram* function of the *matplotlib* library. The source audios used are available at the **audios** folder. The images represent spectrograms of the 1 minute long audios. The x axis stands for time, while the y axis stands for frequency. The images are located at the **images** folder. The events of interest are, normally, the brighter sections of the picture, and their shape and frequency can be used to caracterize different sounds present in nature, such as bird calls. One use of spectrograms, is with audios obtained through Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM), to identify the presence of different species at the recording site.

### Steps

* The first step is to try different image filtering techniques to remove noise. Such as constant sounds present recording, represented by linear segments throughout the entire time axis.
* The second step is to apply image enhancment techniques to try highlighting events of interest. Some possbile techniques are logarithmic enhancement and histogram equalization.
* The final step is to evaluate if the images have been improved and if relevant data has been lost. Inittialy, the evalutaion will be made visually, by verifing if the already known points of interest, provided alongside the recordings, are easily identified. Ideally, the spectrograms will be reverted back to audio format, heard and compared with the original audios. However, this does not concern image processing, and by the purpose of this discipline, may be given less priority if time constraints are present.

## Intial code

Some initial analyses were made applying several filters provided by the **scipy.ndimage** library to the image *LEEC02__0__20161129_054600_ma.png* in the **filtering.py** script. These analyses showed no significant visual  improvement, when applying those filters to the image. The next steps, regarding filtering, will be testing some low-pass, high-pass, bandpass and band-stop filters.
