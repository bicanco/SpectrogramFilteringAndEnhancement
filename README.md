### Abstract
The objective of this project is to remove noise and enhance the spectrograms generated from audio records of soundscapes provided by the Laboratory of Spatial Ecology and Conservantion (LEEC), located at the UNESP's campus of Rio Claro. The main processing tasks involved in this project, are image filtering followed by image enhancement of the spectrograms. The spectrograms are generated by applying a Short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to the audios. These spectrograms are used in the field of bioacoustics and soundscape ecology to help characterize the soundscape and identify species present in the recordings. The output images of this project are spectrograms with reduced noise and enhanced events, presumably helping in species identification.
